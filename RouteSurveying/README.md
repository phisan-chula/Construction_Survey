Route surveying is a type of surveying that is used to determine the location of a route 
or corridor for a road, railway, pipeline, or other linear infrastructure. 
It involves the measurement of distances, angles, and elevations along the route, 
as well as the determination of the route's alignment. Route surveying is used to ensure that 
the route is safe, efficient, and cost-effective.
